                It’s December 31st next year. You’re sipping on your favorite drink—maybe coffee, maybe something a bit stronger (no judgment). You’re scrolling through your Ediary app, laughing at the goals you nervously wrote down last January. Guess what? You nailed most of them.
            </p>

            <p>
                No frantic resolutions to “get it together” this time. You’re proud, grounded, and maybe even a little smug (because who wouldn’t be?).
            </p>
            <p>
                Sounds amazing, right? But let me guess—you’ve tried this before and somewhere along the way, life happened. The plan fell apart, and you told yourself, “Maybe next year.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Not this time. This time, you’re going to stick to it. And it’s not because you’ll suddenly develop superhuman discipline—it’s because you’ll use these five simple, actionable steps to design a life you’ll love. Let’s dive in.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Dream Big—Define Your Vision</h2>
            <p>
                You wouldn’t start a road trip without knowing where you’re going (unless you’re that one friend who always says, “Let’s just wing it”). The same applies to your life. Let’s figure out what your destination looks like.
            </p>

            <h3>Journal Prompts to Get You Started:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What are my top three goals for this year?</strong> Want to switch careers? Save for a trip? Write them down.</li>
                <li><strong>What accomplishments am I most proud of so far?</strong> This isn’t about bragging—it’s about acknowledging your wins.</li>
                <li><strong>How do I want to feel by the end of the year?</strong> Energized, fulfilled, and like the main character in your own story?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> When you have a clear vision, it’s easier to say “yes” to the things that align with it and “no” to distractions.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Break It Down—Turn Big Dreams Into Small Wins</h2>
            <p>
                Big goals are inspiring, but they can also feel overwhelming. You wouldn’t eat an entire pizza in one bite. The secret? Slice your goals into manageable pieces.
            </p>

            <h3>Prompts to Plan Your Path:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What does my ideal day look like?</strong> Does it start with a peaceful morning coffee or end with guilt-free Netflix time?</li>
                <li><strong>What new skills or habits do I want to develop?</strong> Maybe you want to learn how to budget or take up yoga.</li>
                <li><strong>What relationships do I want to nurture?</strong> Is it weekly phone calls or more quality time with kids?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> When you focus on small, actionable steps, progress doesn’t feel overwhelming.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 3: Prioritize Wellness—Your Energy Fuels Everything</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s be real: If you’re running on fumes, no vision board or to-do list will save you. Your health isn’t just part of the plan—it’s the foundation.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflect on These:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What are my health and wellness goals?</strong> Do you want to drink more water or exercise more?</li>
                <li><strong>What brings me joy and peace?</strong> A solo walk or a baking session? Find your happy moments.</li>
                <li><strong>What do I want to let go of?</strong> Whether it’s toxic relationships or self-doubt—declutter your life.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 4: Define Your Legacy—What’s Your Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Pause for a second. Why are you doing all this? It’s not just about ticking off a checklist—it’s about creating a life that feels meaningful to you.
            </p>

            <h3>Explore These Questions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How do I define success?</strong> For some, it’s building a business. For others, it’s having dinner with family every night.</li>
                <li><strong>What legacy do I want to leave behind?</strong> Do you want to be remembered as the family’s glue or the friend who always showed up?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Step 5: Make Journaling a Habit—Your Daily Reset</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s bust a myth right now: “I don’t have time to journal.” Sure, you do. Journaling doesn’t mean writing pages—it can be as simple as jotting down one thought or idea daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life gets messy. Journaling is your reset button—the thing that helps you reflect, recalibrate, and keep moving forward.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Build the Habit:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start small.</strong> Jot down one thought, one win, or one thing you’re grateful for.</li>
                <li><strong>Set a reminder.</strong> Pair journaling with a daily activity like your morning coffee.</li>
                <li><strong>Celebrate the process.</strong> Journaling isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Imagine This:</strong> By next December 31st, you’re reading through your entries and seeing how far you’ve come. Every high, every low, and everything in between—it’s all part of your story.
            </p>
