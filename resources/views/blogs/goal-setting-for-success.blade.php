            5 Steps to Design the Life You’ve Always Dreamed Of
        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            It’s December 31st next year. You’re sipping on your favorite drink—maybe coffee, maybe something a bit stronger (no judgment). You’re scrolling through your Ediary app, laughing at the goals you nervously wrote down last January. Guess what? You nailed most of them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            No frantic resolutions to “get it together” this time. You’re proud, grounded, and maybe even a little smug (because who wouldn’t be?).
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Sounds amazing, right? But let me guess—you’ve tried this before and somewhere along the way, life happened. The plan fell apart, and you told yourself, “Maybe next year.”
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            Not this time. This time, you’re going to stick to it. And it’s not because you’ll suddenly develop superhuman discipline—it’s because you’ll use these five simple, actionable steps to design a life you’ll love. Let’s dive in.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 1: Dream Big—Define Your Vision
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            You wouldn’t start a road trip without knowing where you’re going (unless you’re that one friend who always says, “Let’s just wing it”). The same applies to your life. Let’s figure out what your destination looks like.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Journal Prompts to Get You Started:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
            <li><strong>What are my top three goals for this year?</strong>Want to switch careers? Save for a trip? Or finally figure out how to fold a fitted sheet? Want to finally start that business or just commit to a skincare routine that doesn’t feel like a second job? Write them down.</li>
            <li><strong>What accomplishments am I most proud of so far?</strong>This isn’t about bragging—it’s about acknowledging your wins. Think back to your proudest moments. Maybe it was running your first 5K or surviving a Zoom meeting where your toddler made a surprise appearance. Celebrate those wins—they’re proof you can tackle what’s next.</li>
            <li><strong>How do I want to feel by the end of the year?</strong> Energized, fulfilled, and like the main character in your own story? You’re not chasing vague “happiness”—you’re curating a vibe that feels authentically <em>you</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> When you have a clear vision, it’s easier to say “yes” to the things that align with it and “no” to distractions.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">

        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 2: Break It Down—Turn Big Dreams Into Small Wins
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Big goals are inspiring, but they can also feel overwhelming. You wouldn’t eat an entire pizza in one bite (well, I hope not). The secret? Slice your goals into manageable pieces.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Prompts to Plan Your Path:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
            <li><strong>What does my ideal day look like?</strong> Does it start with a peaceful morning coffee or end with guilt-free Netflix time? Get specific. My ideal day? No emails after 6 PM and at least one random dance break.</li>
            <li><strong>What new skills or habits do I want to develop?</strong> Maybe you want to learn how to budget without hyperventilating, take up yoga, or master the art of making sourdough bread without it resembling a brick.</li>
            <li><strong>What relationships do I want to nurture?</strong> Is it scheduling weekly phone calls with your parents or spending more quality time with your kids instead of doom-scrolling Instagram?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> When you focus on small, actionable steps, progress doesn’t feel overwhelming. It’s like assembling IKEA furniture—one piece at a time (minus the frustration, hopefully).
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 3: Prioritize Wellness—Your Energy Fuels Everything
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Let’s be real: If you’re running on fumes, no vision board or to-do list will save you. Your health isn’t just part of the plan—it’s the foundation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Reflect on These:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
            <li><strong>What are my health and wellness goals?</strong> Do you want to be that person who drinks enough water (without needing an app to remind you)? Or maybe you just want to climb stairs without feeling like you’ve run a marathon.</li>
            <li><strong>What brings me joy and peace?</strong> A solo walk in the park? A baking session where half the dough mysteriously disappears before it’s baked? Find your happy moments and prioritize them.</li>
            <li><strong>What do I want to let go of?</strong> Whether it’s toxic relationships, self-doubt, or those jeans from high school that you <em>will never</em> fit into again—declutter your life and mind.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Why This Matters:</strong> When you feel good physically and mentally, you’re unstoppable. Think of wellness as your secret weapon for smashing those goals.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 4: Define Your Legacy—What’s Your Why?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Pause for a second. Why are you doing all this? It’s not just about ticking off a checklist—it’s about creating a life that feels meaningful to you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Explore These Questions:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
            <li><strong>How do I define success?</strong> For some, it’s building a seven-figure business. For others, it’s having dinner with family every night. Neither is wrong—what’s your definition?</li>
            <li><strong>What legacy do I want to leave behind?</strong> Do you want to be remembered as the family’s glue, the friend who always showed up, or the person who taught everyone how to make perfect pancakes? (Honestly, that’s a legacy worth aiming for.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Imagine This:</strong> By next December, you’re flipping through your journal and seeing a story of purpose, impact, and intentional living. That’s the power of knowing your “why.”
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mt-8 mb-4">
            Step 5: Make Journaling a Habit—Your Daily Reset
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Let’s bust a myth right now: “I don’t have time to journal.” Sure, you do. Journaling doesn’t mean writing pages—it can be as simple as jotting down one thought or idea daily.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Let’s be honest: Life gets messy. Journaling is your reset button—the thing that helps you reflect, recalibrate, and keep moving forward.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">How to Build the Habit:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg md:text-xl mb-4">
            <li><strong>Start small.</strong> Jot down one thought, one win, or one thing you’re grateful for.</li>
            <li><strong>Set a reminder.</strong> Pair journaling with a daily activity like your morning coffee or bedtime routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Celebrate the process.</strong> Journaling isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            <strong>Imagine This:</strong> By next December 31st, you’re reading through your entries and seeing how far you’ve come. Every high, every low, and everything in between—it’s all part of your story.
        </p>
