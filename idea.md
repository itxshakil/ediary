How to build a habit of writing a diary

Your diary is where you empty your thoughts onto a piece of paper. Your diary is a little part of you.

To build a habit of writing a diary, you need to do a few things:

Jot down your current feelings or mood. Don't worry about providing any context for your emotions, just focus on accurately describing what they are. You can then use those feelings and thoughts as prompts for creating detailed diary entries. Work on one thought or emotion at a time and explore it as fully as you can.
For example, if you're feeling sad, you can write a diary entry about why you feel that way and any events that may have contributed.
You can add a line from the lyrics of a song you are often listening to in your entry to preserve the current mood.

Use lots of details to preserve moments in time. Diaries help you preserve thoughts and feelings as they're happening. You're also able to record events immediately after they happen when details are still fresh in your mind. Since memories can become unreliable, especially as time passes, recording precise details vividly can help you preserve moments in time exactly as they occurred.[10]
Detailed writing isn't for everyone, so don't feel like you have to write long, wordy sentences. If you find it easier to express your emotions in short bursts or even bullet points, feel free to do that.
